# CSE-2441--Lab2-Basic_Adders_and_Subtractors
Second lab assignment for CSE2441 (Introduction to Digital Logic). Basic Adders and Subtractors

## Purpose
To introduce you to circuits for adding and subtracting numbers in a twoâ€™s complement number
system. After completing this lab, you will have demonstrated an ability to design four-bit adders
and subtractors, to capture and verify your designs using Quartus II, and to construct and test your
designs on a BB/DE1. Record your prelab and in-lab work in your laboratory notebook. Have your
lab instructor check your results after each part.
